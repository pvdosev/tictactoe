# Tic Tac Toe

A simple project to get used to FLTK and making stuff in C++

## Building

You need FLTK 1.3.8. I have the source `FL/` directory linked in the repo for code completion

In the FLTK tarball, you'll find `fltk-config`. Use it like:

`./fltk-config --compile tictactoe.cpp`

Makefiles? What are those?
